# The Abstraction: Address Spaces
- In the early days, building computer systems was simpler because **user expectations were low**.
- Modern challenges in system design arise from **user demands** for "ease of use," "high performance," and "reliability."
-----
## 13.1 - Early Systems
- **Early Memory Model:** In early machines, there was **no abstraction** for memory management. Physical memory was divided between the **operating system** (starting at address 0) and a **single running program**.
- **Simple OS Structure:** The OS was essentially a **library** of routines in memory, and the user’s program occupied the remaining memory space.
- **Low User Expectations:** Users didn't expect complex features from the OS, making life simpler for early OS developers.
-----
## 13.2 - Multiprogramming and Time Sharing
### Era of Multiprogramming
- **Multiprogramming:** Multiple processes are **ready to run** at the same time, and the OS switches between them, improving CPU utilization. This approach was important when machines were **expensive** and maximizing CPU usage was a priority.
- **Time Sharing:** Introduced to improve **interactivity** for users, allowing multiple users to share a machine concurrently and receive timely responses.
    - Time-sharing systems moved away from **batch computing**, addressing slow program-debug cycles that frustrated developers.
- **Initial Approach to Time Sharing:** One method was to give each process full access to memory, then **save and restore** all state, including memory, between processes. However, this approach was **too slow**, especially as memory grew in size.
### Efficient Time Sharing
- **Solution:** Leave multiple processes in memory and switch between them without saving/restoring the entire memory state, making **time sharing more efficient**.
- **Example Setup:** Multiple processes (A, B, and C) reside in **carved-out sections** of physical memory, and the OS switches between them, running one at a time while others wait in the **ready queue**.
- **Memory Protection:** As time sharing grew in popularity, **memory protection** became critical to prevent processes from reading or writing each other’s memory, ensuring system stability and security.

## 13.3 - The Address Space
### Address Space
- The **address space** is the OS abstraction that provides each running program with its own **view of memory**. It contains:
	- **Code**: The program's instructions.
	- **Stack**: Used to track function calls, local variables, and parameter passing.
	- **Heap**: Dynamically-allocated memory for user-managed data (e.g., `malloc()` in C, `new` in C++/Java).
- **Example Setup:**
    - In a typical address space (e.g., 16KB), **code** is placed at the top, while the **heap** and **stack** grow from opposite ends (heap grows downward, stack grows upward).
### Physical vs. Virtual Addresses
- The **address space** is a **virtual abstraction**, meaning it doesn’t directly map to **physical memory**
- Each process thinks its memory starts at address 0, but the **actual physical memory location** is different (e.g., process A might start at physical address 320KB).
- **Virtual Addresses:** A **virtual address** is what the program uses to reference memory. The OS, with hardware support, translates this into a **physical address**.
- **Example:**
    - If process A tries to access virtual address 0, the OS maps this request to the corresponding **physical address** (e.g., 320KB).
    - This translation is essential for **efficient memory management** and ensures processes don't interfere with each other’s memory.
- **Memory Virtualization:** The OS **virtualizes memory**, creating the illusion of a large, continuous memory space for each process, while **managing physical memory** efficiently and securely.
-----
## 13.4 - Goals
- The main task of the OS in this context is to **virtualize memory**, creating the illusion of private physical memory for each process.
### Key Goals of Virtual Memory (VM)
1. **Transparency:**
    - The VM system should be **invisible** to the running program.
    - Programs should behave as if they have their own **private memory**, unaware of the OS’s behind-the-scenes memory management.
2. **Efficiency:**
    - The OS should ensure memory virtualization is **time-** and **space-efficient**.
    - The goal is to **minimize performance overhead** and **resource usage** while virtualizing memory.
    - **Hardware support** like Translation Lookaside Buffers (TLBs) will be used to aid time-efficient virtualization.
3. **Protection:**
    - The OS must **protect** processes from one another, ensuring **isolation**.
    - A process should not be able to access or modify memory outside its **address space**, safeguarding the system from faulty or malicious processes.
### Next Steps
- Upcoming chapters will explore **mechanisms** (hardware and OS support) for memory virtualization and relevant **policies** for managing memory, such as:
    - **Free space management**.
    - **Page replacement** when memory runs low.
----
# Mechanism: Address Translation
- Virtualizing the CPU was achieved through **Limited Direct Execution (LDE)**, where the OS only intervenes at key moments (e.g., system calls, timer interrupts), allowing for **efficient control**.
- Similarly, **virtualizing memory** will rely on hardware support while ensuring **efficiency and control**.
### Efficiency in Memory Virtualization
- The OS will use **hardware support** for memory management, initially simple (e.g., a few registers) but growing to include features like **TLBs** (Translation Lookaside Buffers) and **page tables**.
- The goal is to make memory access efficient while **protecting applications** from accessing memory outside their address space.
- **Address Translation** is the key technique where the hardware **transforms each virtual memory address** into a corresponding **physical address**. This occurs on **every memory access** (instruction fetch, load, store).
- The **OS manages the memory**, setting up hardware to ensure proper translations occur and maintaining control over memory allocation.
### Flexibility, Control, and Protection
- Programs should be able to use their **address spaces flexibly**, making the system easier to program.
- The OS must ensure **memory protection** and **isolation**, ensuring that processes cannot access others' memory.
- The ultimate goal is to create the **illusion** that each program has its own **private memory**, hiding the reality that many programs share the same physical memory.
- The OS, with hardware assistance, turns this **complex reality** into a **simple and powerful abstraction** for users.
-----
## 15.1 - Assumptions
- Initial virtualization of memory will start with simple assumptions:
	- **Contiguous Memory**: Each user's address space must be placed contiguously in physical memory.
	- **Small Address Space**: The size of each address space is assumed to be less than the size of physical memory.
	- **Equal Address Spaces**: All address spaces are exactly the same size.
- These assumptions are unrealistic, but will help us begin to explore memory virtualization.
-----
## 15.2 - An Example
### Code Example for Address Translation
```c
// The code loads a value from memory, increments it by 3, 
// and stores it back.
void func() {
  int x = 3000;
  x = x + 3;
}
```
- **Assembly** (x86):
	- `movl 0x0(%ebx), %eax` — load the value from memory into register `eax`.
	- `addl $0x03, %eax` — add 3 to the value in `eax`.
	- `movl %eax, 0x0(%ebx)` — store the updated value back into memory.
###  Process Memory Accesses
- The program executes instructions that interact with memory:
    1. **Fetch instruction** from code section at address 128.
    2. **Load value** from stack (address 15 KB).
    3. **Fetch next instruction** at address 132.
    4. **Modify value** (add 3) in the CPU register.
    5. **Store value** back to memory (stack at 15 KB).
### Virtual vs. Physical Memory
- The program thinks it has a **virtual address space** from 0 to 16 KB.
- However, the OS **relocates** the process in **physical memory** (e.g., starting at 32 KB).
- The OS must create the **illusion** of a continuous virtual memory space while placing processes in available physical memory.
- **Key Problem**: How to make a process believe it’s starting at address 0 in its virtual address space, while it is placed elsewhere in physical memory.
- **Solution**: The OS uses **address translation** to remap the program’s virtual addresses to physical addresses transparently.
-----
## 15.3 - Dynamic (Hardware-based) Relocation
### Base and Limit Registers (Dynamic Relocation)
- First introduced in the late 1950s in early time-sharing systems.
- Uses **two hardware registers**:
    - **Base Register**: Stores the start of the process in physical memory.
    - **Bounds (or Limit) Register**: Sets the size of the address space to ensure a process can only access its own memory.
### Address Translation
- Each program is written as if it is loaded at **address 0** in its **virtual address space**.
- The OS sets the **base register** when the program starts, indicating where the process is loaded in **physical memory**.
- **Address Translation Formula**:
    - `Physical Address = Virtual Address + Base`
    - Example: If the base is set to **32 KB** and the program accesses **address 0**, the physical address is **32 KB**.
- The **bounds register** ensures that processes access only their allocated memory.
- Example: If the bounds register is set to **16 KB**, any address generated by the process that exceeds 16 KB will raise a **fault**.
    - Illegal accesses (e.g., too large or negative addresses) trigger exceptions to protect memory isolation.
- The **Memory Management Unit (MMU)** helps perform these address translations.
- More sophisticated memory-management techniques later build on this simple approach.
### Example Address Translations
- Process address space size: **4 KB** loaded at **16 KB** physical memory.
    - Virtual Address **0** → Physical Address **16 KB**.
    - Virtual Address **1 KB** → Physical Address **17 KB**.
    - Virtual Address **3000** → Physical Address **19.384 KB**.
    - Virtual Address **4400** → **Fault** (out of bounds).

## 15.4 - Hardware Support: A Summary
### Privileged CPU Modes
- **User Mode**: Applications run with limited access to the system, preventing them from performing privileged operations.
- **Kernel (Privileged) Mode**: The OS runs in this mode with full access to all hardware and system resources.
- A **single status bit** indicates the current mode of the CPU.
- **Mode Switching**: Occurs during special events like system calls or interrupts, allowing the CPU to switch from user to kernel mode.
### Base and Bounds Registers
- **Base Register**: Holds the starting physical address of a process’s memory.
- **Bounds Register**: Stores the size or limit of the address space, ensuring that processes cannot access memory beyond their assigned space.
- **Memory Management Unit (MMU)**: Manages base and bounds registers and performs address translations.
### Address Translation
- **Virtual Address to Physical Address**: The CPU adds the base register value to a virtual address to produce the correct physical address.
- The **bounds register** ensures that the address is within the valid range before access is granted.
- Both translation and bounds checking are handled automatically by the **hardware**.
### Privileged Instructions
- The OS needs **privileged instructions** to modify the **base** and **bounds registers** when switching between processes.
- Only in **kernel mode** can these registers be updated to ensure security.
- If a user program tries to modify these registers, the hardware will generate an **exception**.
### Exception Handling
- The CPU must support **exceptions** for:
    - **Out-of-bounds memory access**: When a process tries to access memory outside its bounds.
    - **Privileged instruction violations**: When a user-mode program attempts to execute privileged instructions.
- **Exception Handlers**: The OS provides handlers for these exceptions, which terminate the offending process or take corrective action.
### Hardware Requirements Overview
- **Privileged Mode**: Needed to restrict access to critical operations.
- **Base/Bounds Registers**: Used to translate and protect memory access.
- **Address Translation**: Hardware circuitry checks the validity of memory accesses.
- **Privileged Instructions**: Allow the OS to manage memory and set exception handlers.
- **Exception Raising**: Ensures that illegal operations trigger OS intervention.

## 15.5 - Operating System Issues
### Process Creation
- When a process is created, the OS allocates space for its address space using a **free list** to track available slots in memory.
- For each new process, the OS finds a free slot, marks it as used, and relocates the process into that slot.
### Process Termination
- When a process exits or is terminated, the OS reclaims its memory by putting it back on the free list.
- The OS also cleans up any associated data structures related to the process.
### Context Switching
- During a context switch, the OS must save the current process’s **base** and **bounds** register values in a per-process structure (e.g., Process Control Block or PCB).
- When switching to a new process, the OS restores the base and bounds values for the new process to ensure it runs in its own address space.
- The OS can also move a process’s address space in memory by updating the base register when the process is descheduled.
### Exception Handling
- The OS sets up exception handlers at boot time to manage errors, such as when a process tries to access out-of-bounds memory.
- When a process misbehaves (e.g., illegal memory access), the OS terminates the process and reclaims its resources.
### Hardware/OS Interaction
- Most memory translations are handled by hardware without OS intervention, following the principle of **limited direct execution**.
- The OS becomes involved when exceptions arise or during context switching to maintain memory isolation and control.

# Segmentation
- Previously, entire process address spaces were placed contiguously in memory, causing **waste** between the **stack** and **heap**.
- The **base and bounds** approach relocates processes but still leaves unused memory in physical space.
- **Memory Waste**: Unused space between the stack and heap still consumes physical memory.
- **Limited Flexibility**: Requires the entire address space to fit in memory, which becomes difficult when memory is scarce.
- **How to Support Large Address Spaces Efficiently?** We need a more flexible way to allocate memory without wasting space in unused regions like the stack-heap gap.
