# Introduction to Operating Systems
- **Definition and Purpose:**
    - An Operating System (OS) is software that manages the computer’s hardware resources.
    - It simplifies running programs, sharing memory, and interacting with devices, ensuring efficient and correct system operations.
- **Von Neumann Model:** Programs execute by fetching, decoding, and executing instructions sequentially on the CPU.
- **Virtualization**
	- **Concept:**
	    - The OS virtualizes physical resources (CPU, memory, disk) into more powerful, easy-to-use virtual resources.
	    - This makes the OS act like a virtual machine.
	- **APIs:** The OS provides interfaces (APIs) for users to interact with the system, such as running programs and accessing files.
	- **Role of OS:** The OS manages resources like CPU, memory, and disks, ensuring they are shared efficiently among multiple programs.

## 2.1 - Virtualizing the CPU
### Running Multiple Programs Simultaneously
- **Observation:** A single CPU can appear to run multiple programs at the same time, even though it only executes one instruction at a time.
- **Illusion of Multiple CPUs:**
    - The OS creates the illusion of many virtual CPUs from a single physical CPU, allowing multiple programs to seemingly run concurrently.
    - This process is known as **CPU virtualization**.
### Role of the Operating System
- **Virtualization:**
    - The OS, with hardware support, manages the illusion of multiple CPUs by rapidly switching between programs, giving the appearance of concurrent execution.
    - This is a key function of the OS, enabling efficient multitasking.
- **Interfaces (APIs):**
    - To control program execution (starting, stopping, managing), the OS provides Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).
    - Users and applications interact with the OS primarily through these APIs, which are crucial for multitasking and resource management.
### OS Policies and Resource Management
- **Decision-Making:**
    - The OS must decide which programs run at any given time, especially when multiple programs are ready to run simultaneously.
    - This decision-making process is governed by OS **policies**.
- **Resource Manager Role:** The OS acts as a resource manager, handling CPU time, memory, and other resources, ensuring that all programs are allocated resources fairly and efficiently.
- **Key Questions:**
    - How does the OS decide which program to run?
    - How does the OS ensure efficient use of resources?

## 2.2 - Virtualizing Memory
### Physical Memory Basics
- **Memory as an Array:**
    - Physical memory in modern machines is a simple array of bytes.
    - **Reading/Writing Memory:** To read or write data in memory, a specific address must be specified.
    - **Memory Access During Program Execution:** Programs access memory constantly for data structures, instructions, and more.
### Example Program (Memory Allocation)
```c title:mem.c
#include <unistd.h> 
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "common.h"

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { 
	int *p = malloc(sizeof(int));
	assert(p != NULL);
	printf("(%d) address pointed to by p: %p\n", getpid(), p);
	*p = 0;
	while (1) { 
		Spin(1);
		*p = *p + 1;
		printf("(%d) p: %d\n", getpid(), *p);
	}
	
	return 0;
}
```
- **Program Behavior:**
    - The program allocates memory using `malloc()`.
    - It prints the memory address, initializes the memory, and then updates the value in a loop, printing the process ID (PID) each time.
    - **Observation:** Each program instance appears to access the same memory address, yet operates independently.
### Memory Virtualization by the OS
- **Virtual Address Space:**
    - The OS virtualizes memory, giving each process its own private virtual address space.
    - **Private Memory:**
        - Each running program believes it has exclusive access to its memory, even though physical memory is a shared resource.
    - **OS Role:** The OS maps each process's virtual address space to physical memory, ensuring that memory references in one process do not interfere with others.

## 2.3 - Concurrency
### Introduction to Concurrency
- **Definition:**
    - **Concurrency** refers to the challenges that arise when multiple tasks are executed simultaneously within the same program.
    - Initially, these issues were mainly observed within operating systems, as they manage multiple processes simultaneously.
- **Modern Relevance:** Concurrency issues are now common in multi-threaded programs, not just in the OS.
### Example Program (Multi-threaded Program)
```c title:threads.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "common.h"
#include "common_threads.h"

volatile int counter = 0;
int loops;

void *worker(void *arg) { 
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < loops; i++) { counter++; } 
	return NULL;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { 
	if (argc != 2) { 
		fprintf(stderr, "usage: threads <value>\n");
		exit(1);
	}
	loops = atoi(argv[1]);
	pthread_t p1, p2;
	printf("Initial value : %d\n", counter);
	
	Pthread_create(&p1, NULL, worker, NULL);
	Pthread_create(&p2, NULL, worker, NULL);
	Pthread_join(p1, NULL);
	Pthread_join(p2, NULL);
	
	printf("Final value : %d\n", counter);
	return 0;
}
```

- **Basic Concept:**
    - A program creates two threads using `Pthread_create()`.
    - Each thread runs a function (`worker()`) that increments a shared counter in a loop.
- **Expected Outcome:** If the loop runs 1000 times per thread, the final value of the counter should be 2000 (assuming two threads).
### Concurrency Problems
- **Unexpected Results:**
    - When running the program with higher loop values (e.g., 100,000), the final counter value can be incorrect and inconsistent (e.g., 143,012 or 137,298 instead of 200,000).
    - Re-running the program can yield different results each time.
- **Root Cause:**
    - The issue arises because the counter increment operation involves multiple steps:
        1. Load the counter value from memory.
        2. Increment the value.
        3. Store the updated value back in memory.
    - These steps do not occur **atomically** (all at once), leading to race conditions where threads interfere with each other’s updates.
### Importance of Concurrency Handling
- **Key Takeaway:**
    - Proper management of concurrency is crucial to avoid inconsistencies and ensure correct program behavior.
    - We will explore this topic in detail, focusing on how to address and solve concurrency problems in multi-threaded programs and operating systems.

## 2.4 - Persistence
### Introduction to Persistence
- **Definition:**
    - **Persistence** refers to the ability to store data in a way that survives system crashes or power losses.
    - Unlike volatile memory (e.g., DRAM), which loses data when power is lost, persistent storage ensures data longevity.
### Hardware and Software for Persistence
- **Hardware:** Persistent storage is typically managed by I/O devices like hard drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs).
- **Software:**
    - The **file system** is the OS component responsible for managing data storage on these devices.
    - It ensures that files are stored reliably and efficiently on the disk.
### File System Operations
- **Shared Access:**
    - Unlike CPU and memory, the OS does not provide a private virtualized disk for each application; instead, files are often shared across processes.
    - Example: Writing and compiling a C program involves multiple processes (e.g., an editor, a compiler) interacting with the same files.
- **File System's Role:** The file system determines where data is stored on the disk and tracks it using various data structures.
### Challenges in Managing Persistent Data
- **I/O Requests:**
    - Writing to disk involves issuing complex I/O requests to the storage device, requiring deep knowledge of device interfaces.
- **Performance Optimization:**
    - **Delayed Writes:** File systems often delay writes to batch them, improving performance.
    - **Crash Recovery:** Techniques like **journaling** or **copy-on-write** ensure that the system can recover to a consistent state after a crash during a write operation.
- **Data Structures:**
    - File systems use various data structures (e.g., lists, B-trees) to manage data efficiently.

## 2.5 - Design Goals
###  Key Goals in OS Design
- **Abstraction:**
    - **Definition:** Abstractions simplify complex systems by breaking them down into manageable pieces.
    - **Importance:** Fundamental in computer science; allows development in high-level languages without dealing with low-level details like assembly or logic gates.
    - **OS Design:** Each section of the OS relies on well-defined abstractions to manage resources effectively.
- **Performance:**
    - **Minimizing Overheads:** The OS must provide virtualization and other features without excessive use of time (instructions) or space (memory/disk).
    - **Trade-offs:** Striving for high performance often requires balancing between different resource demands.
- **Protection:**
    - **Application Isolation:** The OS must protect applications from each other, preventing one program’s failure or malicious behavior from affecting others.
    - **OS Protection:** The OS itself must be safeguarded from applications to ensure system stability.
    - **Isolation:** This principle is key to providing protection within the OS.
- **Reliability:**
    - **Continuous Operation:** The OS must run continuously without failure, as its failure affects all running applications.
    - **Challenge:** Building a reliable OS is complex, often involving millions of lines of code and ongoing research.
### Additional Design Considerations
- **Energy Efficiency:**
    - **Relevance:** With increasing focus on environmental sustainability, energy-efficient OS design is crucial.
- **Security:**
    - **Extension of Protection:** Security involves protecting the OS and applications from malicious attacks, especially in a networked environment.
- **Mobility:**
    - **Adaptation:** As OSes are used on smaller, portable devices, mobility becomes a critical consideration in design.
### Adaptability Across Devices
- **General Principles:** These principles apply broadly across different types of devices, from desktops to mobile phones, though specific implementations may vary.

## 2.6 - Some History
### Early Operating Systems: Just Libraries
- **Initial Purpose:**
    - Early OSes were essentially libraries of commonly-used functions.
    - They provided APIs for low-level I/O handling, simplifying development.
- **Batch Processing:**
    - Mainframe systems typically ran one program at a time, managed by a human operator.
    - **Batch Processing:** Multiple jobs were executed in batches, with no real-time interaction due to high costs.
### Evolution Beyond Libraries: Protection
- **Realization:** As systems evolved, it became clear that OS code needed special privileges to manage hardware securely.
- **Introduction of System Calls:**
    - **System Call vs. Procedure Call:** System calls involve a transition to OS control with elevated privileges (kernel mode).
    - **User Mode vs. Kernel Mode:**
        - **User Mode:** Applications run with restricted access to system resources.
        - **Kernel Mode:** The OS has full access to hardware, enabling it to perform critical tasks like I/O operations and memory management.
### The Era of Multiprogramming
- **Impact of Minicomputers:** Minicomputers, such as the PDP series, made computing more accessible and affordable, leading to increased developer activity.
- **Multiprogramming:** The OS could load multiple jobs into memory and switch between them, optimizing CPU utilization by overlapping computation with I/O operations.
    - **Challenges:**
        - Memory protection became crucial to prevent one program from interfering with another.
        - Handling concurrency and interrupts correctly was essential to ensure system stability.
- **UNIX Operating System:**
    - UNIX, developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, simplified many ideas from earlier systems and became widely influential.
    - UNIX’s modularity and simplicity led to its widespread adoption and ongoing influence on modern operating systems.
### The Modern Era: Personal Computers
- **PC Revolution:** The rise of personal computers (e.g., Apple II, IBM PC) made computing accessible to the masses, with one machine per user.
- **Initial Setbacks:**
    - Early PC operating systems like DOS lacked key features, such as memory protection, leading to system instability.
    - Mac OS (pre-OS X) had limited job scheduling, making it vulnerable to system-wide crashes.
- **Reintroduction of Advanced OS Features:**
    - Over time, features from minicomputer OSes were reintroduced to desktops.
    - **macOS (formerly Mac OS X):** Built on UNIX, incorporating its robust features.
    - **Windows NT:** Marked a significant improvement in Microsoft’s OS technology, adopting many advanced concepts.
- **Modern Mobile and Embedded Systems:**
    - Today’s mobile devices run OSes (like Linux-based Android) that are more akin to 1970s minicomputer systems than early PCs.
    - This evolution reflects the enduring value of the foundational principles developed during the heyday of OS innovation.
